Usage
=====

glTFâ„¢ (GL Transmission Format) is used for transmission and loading of 3D models
in web and native applications. glTF reduces the size of 3D models and the
runtime processing needed to unpack and render those models. This format is
commonly used on the web, and has upcoming support in native 3D engines such as
Unity3D and Unreal Engine 4.

This importer/exporter supports the following glTF 2.0 features:

- Meshes
- Materials (Principled BSDF and Unlit)
- Textures
- Cameras
- Punctual Lights (point, spot, and directional)
- Animation (keyframe, shape key, and skinning)

.. note::

  Certain features require extensions to the core format specification. The
  following `glTF 2.0 extensions<https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions>`_
  are supported:

   - KHR_lights_punctual
   - KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness
   - KHR_materials_unlit
   - KHR_texture_transform

Materials
---------

Import
^^^^^^

Supports Principled BSDF (Metal/Rough PBR) , Spec/Gloss PBR, and Emissive
(Unlit) materials.

Export
^^^^^^

Supports Principled BSDF (Metal/Rough PBR) and Emissive (Unlit) materials.

.. note::

  Only certain properties of the Principled BSDF material are supported:

   - Base Color
   - Metallic (B channel)
   - Roughness (G channel)
   - Normal
   - Tangent
   - Blend Mode (Opaque, Alpha Blend, Alpha Clip)

Complex nodes cannot be exported. For best results when using nodes, prefer
the following structure:

TODO: Add node graph figure.

To create unlit (shadeless) materials, use:

TODO: Add node graph figure.

Animation
---------

glTF allows multiple animations per file, with animations targeted to particular
objects at time of export. To ensure that an animation is included, either (a)
make it the active Action on the object, (b) create a single-strip NLA track,
or (c) stash the action.

.. note::

  Only certain types of animation are supported:

   - Keyframe (translation, rotation, scale)
   - Shape Keys
   - Armatures / Skinning

  Animation of other properties, like lights or materials, will be ignored.

Custom Properties
-----------------

Custom properties on most objects are preserved in glTF export/import, and may
be used for user-specific purposes.

Contributing
=============

glTF 2.0 is a relatively new file format. Discussion and development of the
format occurs on the Khronos Group `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF>`_, and feedback there
is welcome. This importer/exporter is developed via the `glTF-Blender-IO
repository <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO>`_, where you can
file bug reports, submit feature requests, or contribute code.
